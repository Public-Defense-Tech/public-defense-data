# Contributing

## Development Ethos

- Write code simply to make it more accessible for new developers to contribute over the long run.
  - Make your code easier to read, even if at the expense of being more succinct.
  - Use commonly used and well-maintained libraries and approaches
  - Document and notate your code.

## How to Report an Issue

- If something breaks make an [Issue](../../issues)
  - Provide the date, JO, case number, and county that you were scraping. (if known)
  - Paste all error text.
